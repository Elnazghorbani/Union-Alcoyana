This repository contains the preprocessing step for a larger project using real-world data provided by Union Alcoyana, an insurance company. The dataset includes detailed information on policies and customers, and this preprocessing phase focuses on cleaning, transforming, and preparing the data for subsequent analysis and modeling. A R code here is for the feature selection phase. This project is ongoing, and I am already working on the prediction part.
